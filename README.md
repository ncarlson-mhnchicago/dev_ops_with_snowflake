# Getting Started with Snowflake DevOps

This repository contains the code for the *Getting Started with Snowflake DevOps* quickstart.

## Overview

Are you interested in bringing your database game to the next level by unleashing the power of Snowflake DevOps, empowering you to build safe and robust data pipelines? Well then, this Quickstart is for you!

In this guide, we will apply DevOps techniques to a data pipeline. We will automate the deployment of declarative database changes from Git, create a CI/CD pipeline, and separate our dev and prod environments. You'll also learn how to use Snowflake's marketplace to enrich your data without incurring storage costs, get to know the new developer CLI tool and Visual Studio Code extension.

By the end of the session, you will have learned everything you need to get started with DevOps in Snowflake.

## Step-By-Step Guide
